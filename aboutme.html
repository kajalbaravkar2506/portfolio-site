    <div class="about">
      Hello! I am Kajal Baravkar, a 2 <sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science Engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology.
      I have a deep interest in both web development and graphic design, and I enjoy combining technology with creativity
      to craft clean, bold, and visually impactful experiences. My work allows me to bridge logic and aesthetics —
      whether I'm coding an interface or designing a brand identity.
      <br><br>
      Currently, I am working with Vertex as a Creative Graphic Designer, where I get to experiment with fresh ideas and
      challenge the boundaries of conventional design. It's a space where I grow, collaborate, and bring concepts to life
      through visual storytelling.
      <br><br>
      This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far — a place to showcase the skills I am building,
      and the passion that drives me. And this is just the beginning!
